# Google Translate - Desktop App

Simple electron desktop app that just render official Google translate page.

I made this app for practice and I think maybe someone else can find it useful as well.

This app is build for people who would like to have Google Translate like separate application. Hopefully, it should help you a lot with translations on daily basis.

In the [releases](https://github.com/SrdjanMilic/google-translate/releases) section, there is distributable builds for Linux/Windows, and installer file for Windows. If you want to run app from distributable build, just double click on "storrent" executable in root directory. Installer for Windows works like expected, although due to the module compiler, app executable ends up in the "...AppData\Local\storrent\" and not in the "...\Program Files\" like it should be.

To locally start the application from source, you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then cd to directory and run:

1. npm update
2. npm start

New improvements and fixes will be implemented as time goes by.
