# google-translate

Very simple electron desktop app that actually just render official Google translate page.

I made this app for practice and I think maybe someone else can find it useful as well.

Could be upgraded in the future. Also, you can send pull requests if you wish.

You can be free to download, use and modify this app on your own.
