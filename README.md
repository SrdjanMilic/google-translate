# Google Translate

Simple electron desktop app that just render official Google translate page.

I made this app for practice and I think maybe someone else can find it useful as well.

Could be upgraded in the future.

There is distributable build and installer file.
In the windows branch you can find the same for windows users

To start the application from source run:
1. npm update
2. npm start
