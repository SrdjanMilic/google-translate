# Google Translate

Simple electron desktop app that just render official Google translate page.

I made this app for practice and I think maybe someone else can find it useful as well. 
Should be upgraded in the future.

In the [releases](https://github.com/SrdjanMilic/STorrent/releases) section, there is distributable builds for linux/windows, and installer file for windows.

To start the application from source run:
1. npm update
2. npm start
